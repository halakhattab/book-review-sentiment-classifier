For example, a company like Amazon or Goodreads could automatically flag or feature positive reviews, improving user experience and engagement.

Predictive sentiment analysis models can reduce manual review efforts and enhance strategic decision-making in content-driven platforms. "

    "In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify book reviews as positive or not, using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning. After preparing the text data with TF-IDF vectorization, I trained and evaluated multiple models, including Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes. Logistic Regression delivered the best performance with an F1-score of 0.82 and balanced precision and recall across both classes. A grid search confirmed that the default parameters were optimal for this model. Overall, the model demonstrates strong generalization and could be valuable for platforms that rely on automated sentiment classification to enhance user experience and content curation. Future improvements could include experimenting with deep learning models or incorporating additional linguistic features for even greater accuracy."
